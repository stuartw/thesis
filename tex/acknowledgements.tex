I would like to thank Professor Dornan and PPARC for giving me the opportunity to study particle physics at Imperial College.

I would like to thank my supervisor, Dave Colling, for his guidance during the last three years and for teaching me HEP computing, which he very nearly made interesting. My one C++ course has been bolstered by Hugh Tallini and Kostas Georgiou. Hugh wrote the original version of GROSS and Kostas provided much-appreciated advice about the many changes applied later, as well as computing in general.

Sasha Nikitenko has been invaluable for guiding my physics analysis, especially given how little physics I knew when I started.

Given the nature of this thesis there are many people within the LCG/EGEE and CMS collaborations without whom this work would not have been possible. Thank you for your efforts.

If this thesis presents my work clearly and concisely it is only because of proof-reading by Dave Colling, Barry MacEvoy and Sebastien Greder.

I would also like to thank all those at Imperial who have made me glad I did not resign on my first day. I can't name them all, suffice to say it includes everyone that has bought me a drink after work.

Finally, I would like to thank my friends and family, especially my Mum without whom I would not be where I am now.
