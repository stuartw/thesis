discussion is aimed at readers who are familiar with the Standard Model and
quantum field theory, but who have had little or no prior exposure to
supersymmetry. Topics covered include: motivations for supersymmetry, the
construction of supersymmetric Lagrangians, supersymmetry-breaking
interactions, the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), R-parity and
its consequences, the origins of supersymmetry breaking, the mass spectrum of
the MSSM, decays of supersymmetric particles, experimental signals for
supersymmetry, and some extensions of the minimal framework.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes DIRAC, the LHCb Monte Carlo production system. DIRAC has
a client/server architecture based on: Compute elements distributed among the
collaborating institutes; Databases for production management, bookkeeping (the
metadata catalogue) and software configuration; Monitoring and cataloguing
services for updating and accessing the databases. Locally installed software
agents implemented in Python monitor the local batch queue, interrogate the
production database for any outstanding production requests using the XML-RPC
protocol and initiate the job submission. The agent checks and, if necessary,
installs any required software automatically. After the job has processed the
events, the agent transfers the output data and updates the metadata catalogue.
DIRAC has been successfully installed at 18 collaborating institutes, including
the DataGRID, and has been used in recent Physics Data Challenges. In the near
to medium term future we must use a mixed environment with different types of
grid middleware or no middleware. We describe how this flexibility has been
achieved and how ubiquitously available grid middleware would improve DIRAC.},

	Abstract = {The Gaudi/Athena and Grid Alliance (GANGA) is a front-end for the
configuration, submission, monitoring, bookkeeping, output collection, and
reporting of computing jobs run on a local batch system or on the grid. In
particular, GANGA handles jobs that use applications written for the Gaudi
software framework shared by the Atlas and LHCb experiments. GANGA exploits the
commonality of Gaudi-based computing jobs, while insulating against grid-,
batch- and framework-specific technicalities, to maximize end-user productivity
in defining, configuring, and executing jobs. Designed for a python-based
component architecture, GANGA has a modular underpinning and is therefore well
placed for contributing to, and benefiting from, work in related projects. Its
functionality is accessible both from a scriptable command-line interface, for
expert users and automated tasks, and through a graphical interface, which
simplifies the interaction with GANGA for beginning and c1asual users.
<br />This paper presents the GANGA design and implementation, the development of
the underlying software bus architecture, and the functionality of the first
public GANGA release.},

account leading electroweak two-loop and leading higher-order QCD corrections.
The Higgs-boson masses are calculated as functions of the MSSM parameters for
general mixing in the scalar top sector and arbitrary choices of the parameters

high-energy-physics `events', i.e. sets of outgoing particles produced in the
interactions between two incoming particles. The objective is to provide as
accurate as possible a representation of event properties in a wide range of
reactions. The underlying physics is not understood well enough to give an
exact description; the programs therefore contain a combination of analytical
results and various models. The emphasis in this article is on new aspects, but
a few words of general introduction are included. Further documentation is

	Abstract = {The Higgs boson search has shifted from LEP2 to the Tevatron and will
subsequently move to the LHC. The current limits from the Tevatron and the
prospective sensitivities at the LHC are often interpreted in specific MSSM
scenarios. For heavy Higgs boson production and subsequent decay into b \bar b
or tau^+ tau^-, the present Tevatron data allow to set limits in the
M_A-tan_beta plane for small M_A and large tan_beta values. Similar channels
have been explored for the LHC, where the discovery reach extends to higher
values of M_A and smaller tan_beta. Searches for MSSM charged Higgs bosons,
produced in top decays or in association with top quarks, have also been
investigated at the Tevatron and the LHC. We analyze the current Tevatron
limits and prospective LHC sensitivities. We discuss how robust they are with
respect to variations of the other MSSM parameters and possible improvements of
the theoretical predictions for Higgs boson production and decay. It is shown
that the inclusion of supersymmetric radiative corrections to the production
cross sections and decay widths leads to important modifications of the present
limits on the MSSM parameter space. The impact on the region where only the
lightest MSSM Higgs boson can be detected at the LHC is also analyzed. We
propose to extend the existing benchmark scenarios by including additional
values of the higgsino mass parameter mu. This affects only slightly the search
channels for a SM-like Higgs boson, while having a major impact on the searches
for non-standard MSSM Higgs bosons.},

	Abstract = {The MonALISA (Monitoring Agents in A Large Integrated Services Architecture) system provides a distributed monitoring service. MonALISA is based on a scalable Dynamic Distributed Services Architecture which is designed to meet the needs of physics collaborations for monitoring global Grid systems, and is implemented using JINI/JAVA and WSDL/SOAP technologies. The scalability of the system derives from the use of multithreaded Station Servers to host a variety of loosely coupled self-describing dynamic services, the ability of each service to register itself and then to be discovered and used by any other services, or clients that require such information, and the ability of all services and clients subscribing to a set of events (state changes) in the system to be notified automatically. The framework integrates several existing monitoring tools and procedures to collect parameters describing computational nodes, applications and network performance. It has built-in SNMP support and network-performance monitoring algorithms that enable it to monitor end-to-end network performance as well as the performance and state of site facilities in a Grid. MonALISA is currently running around the clock on the US CMS test Grid as well as an increasing number of other sites. It is also being used to monitor the performance and optimize the interconnections among the reflectors in the VRVS system.},

	Abstract = {The Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) is a 5000 t magnetic detector built to study collisions at the Fermilab Tevatron. Event analysis is based on charged particle tracking, magnetic momentum analysis and fine-grained calorimetry. The combined electromagnetic and hadron calorimetry has approximately uniform granularity in rapidity-azimuthal angle and extends down to 2[deg] from the beam direction. Various tracking chambers cover the calorimeter acceptance and extend charged particle tracking down to 2 mrad from the beam direction. Charged particle momenta are analyzed in a 1.5 T solenoidal magnetic field, generated by a superconducting coil which is 3 m in diameter and 5 m in length. The central tracking chamber measures particle momenta with a resolution better then [delta]pT/pT2 = 2 x 10-3 (GeV/c)-1 in the region 40[deg] PT/pT2 -3 for 21[deg] < [theta] < 40[deg] and 140[deg] < [theta] < 159[deg]. The calorimetry, which has polar angle coverage from 2[deg] to 178[deg] and full azimuthal coverage, consists of electromagnetic shower counters and hadron calorimeters, and is segmented into about 5000 projective "towers" or solid angle elements. Muon coverage is provided by drift chambers in the region 56[deg] < [theta] < 124[deg], and by large forward toroid systems in the range 3[deg] < [theta] < 16[deg] and 164[deg] < [theta] < 177[deg]. Isolated high momentum muons can be identified in the intermediate angular range by a comparison of the tracking and calorimeter information in many cases. A custom front-end electronics system followed by a large Fastbus network provides the readout of the approximately 100 000 detector channels. Fast Level 1 and Level 2 triggers make a detailed pre-analysis of calorimetry and tracking information; a Level 3 system of on-line processors will do parallel processing of events. This paper provides a summary of the aspects of the detector which are relevant to its physics capabilities, with references to more detailed descriptions of the subsystems.},

ROOT written in C++, contains, among others, an efficient hierarchical OO database, a C++ interpreter, advanced statistical analysis (multi-dimensional histogramming, fitting, minimization, cluster finding algorithms) and visualization tools. The user interacts with ROOT via a graphical user interface, the command line or batch scripts. The command and scripting language is C++ (using the interpreter) and large scripts can be compiled and dynamically linked in. The OO database design has been optimized for parallel access (reading as well as writing) by multiple processes.},

	Abstract = {The CMS experiment is currently developing a computing system capable of serving, processing and archiving the large number of events that will be generated when the CMS detector starts taking data. During 2004 CMS undertook a large scale data challenge to demonstrate the ability of the CMS computing system to cope with a sustained data-taking rate equivalent to 25% of startup rate. Its goals were: to run CMS event reconstruction at CERN for a sustained period at 25 Hz input rate; to distribute the data to several regional centers; and enable data access at those centers for analysis. Grid middleware was utilized to help complete all aspects of the challenge. To continue to provide scalable access from anywhere in the world to the data, CMS is developing a layer of software that uses Grid tools to gain access to data and resources, and that aims to provide physicists with a user friendly interface for submitting their analysis jobs. This paper describes the data challenge experience with Grid infrastructure and the current development of the CMS analysis system.},

	Abstract = {We present a first study of the channel H, A -\&gt; tau+tau -\&gt; h+ + h- + X in CMS
at high m(A) values where no triggering difficulties are expected with QCD
jets. At present the tau selection is based solely on the presence of a hard
isolated track in the "tau" jet, but further refinements based on calorimeter
collimation or impact parameter selections are obviously possible. The main
irreducible background in these conditions is due to QCD jets with hard
fragmentations. A large reduction of this background and improvement in the
expected signal to background ratio is provided by Etmiss cuts. The expected
high-mass reach in the m(A) tan(beta) parameter space for 3 x 10**4pb**-1 is
shown. This H -\&gt; tau+tau channel provides the highest mass reach and the best
mass resolution when compared to tau,tau -\&gt; lepton+hadron + Xand tau,tau -\&gt;
electton + muon + X final states. To the extent that with further calorimetric
and impact parameter based selection criteria the QCD background can be kept
under control, i.e. below the irreducible Z,gamma* -\&gt; tau+tau background, we
should strive to have a first level trigger allowing to explore the mass range
down to ~ 150 - 200 GeV.},

2002 the distribution of tasks among the different regional centers has been
done mainly through manual operations, even though some tools for data transfer

prototypes of CMS distributed productions based on grid middleware have been
deployed, demonstrating that it is possible to use them for real data

It describes patterns for managing object creation, composing objects into larger structures, and coordinating control flow between objects. The book provides numerous examples where using composition rather than inheritance can improve the reusability and flexibility of code. Note, though, that it's not a tutorial but a catalog that you can use to find an object-oriented design pattern that's appropriate for the needs of your particular application--a selection for virtuoso programmers who appreciate (or require) consistent, well-engineered object-oriented designs.} {Now on CD, this internationally acclaimed bestseller is more valuable than ever! <P> Use the contents of the CD to create your own design documents and reusable components. The CD contains: 23 patterns you can cut and paste into your own design documents; sample code demonstrating pattern implementation; complete Design Patterns content in standard HTML format, with numerous hyperlinked cross-references; accessed through a standard web browser; Java-based dynamic search mechanism, enhancing online seach capabilities; graphical user environment, allowing ease of navigation. <P> First published in 1995, this landmark work on object-oriented software design presents a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to common design problems. Created by four experienced designers, the 23 patterns contained herein have become an essential resource for anyone developing reusable object-oriented software. In response to reader demand, the complete text and pattern catalog are now available on CD-ROM. This electronic version of <i>Design Patterns</i> enables programmers to install the book directly onto a computer or network for use as an online reference for creating reusable object-oriented software. <P> The authors first describe what patterns are and how they can help you in the design process. They then systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. All patterns are compiled from real-world examples and include code that demonstrates how they may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages such as C++ and Smalltalk. Readers who already own the book will want the CD to take advantage of its dynamic search mechanism and ready-to-install patterns.}},

While the Net allows users everywhere to share information, the Grid will allow users to share raw computing power.

The potential benefits to science, government, and business may well be beyond imagination.<p> Foster and Kesselman have gathered together essays, proposals, and ruminations of more than 30 distinguished stars of the high-speed computing and networking world in order to do four things: make the case for developing computational grids, provide ideas on how such grids may be designed, demonstrate how the grids might be used, and point out the research still needed to make it happen. While the book was written to serve as a possible textbook in advanced networking, it makes fascinating reading for anyone interested in the future of network computing.<p> The text covers Grid applications, the programming tools required, the services that will be provided, and an examination of Grid infrastructure.

	Abstract = {GROSS (GRidified Orca Submission System) has been developed to provide CMS end users with a single interface for running batch analysis tasks over the LCG-2 Grid. The main purpose of the tool is to carry out job splitting, preparation, submission, monitoring and archiving in a transparent way which is simple to use for the end user. Central to its design has been the requirement for allowing multi-user analyses, and to accomplish this all persistent information is stored on a backend MySQL database. This database is additionally shared with BOSS, to which GROSS interfaces in order to provide job submission and real time monitoring capability. In this paper we present an overview of GROSS's architecture and functionality and report on first user tests of the system using CMS Data Challenge 2004 data (DC04).},

	Abstract = {We present a search for neutral supersymmetric Higgs bosons decaying to tau pairs produced in p-pbar collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV. The data, corresponding to 310 pb^(-1) integrated luminosity, were collected with the CDF II detector at the Tevatron collider at Fermilab. No significant excess above the standard model backgrounds is observed. We set exclusion limits on the production cross section times branching fraction to tau pairs for Higgs masses in the range from 90 to 250 GeV/c^2.},
